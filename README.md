# Villanelle Writer

This is a simple app to help writing villanelles. I wrote it mostly an excuse to toy with react. This code in no way represents my normal work.

Visit the [live demo here](http://peticol.as/villanelle-writer/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basics

* `npm start` - Starts the local server.
* `npm run build && npm run deploy` - Builds and deploys, push `main` first.
